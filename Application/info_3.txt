These will be the major negative of climate change all around the world:
--> There will be an estimated 1-4 feet rise in sea level, which will render many places under sea level, like Venice, Florida inhabitable
--> Tropical storms will become more deadly and strong, due to larger amounts of water flooding in derived from the major melting sea ice at the poles.
--> Many species in places like Arctic will become extinct because of immense rise in temperature and lack of ice.
--> Many habitats around the world will be modified with some of their species being endangered due to the disruption of regular seasonal cycles, increased temperature or lack of resources to survive.
--> There will be more droughts and heat waves, however in other parts of the world be hurricanes and aquatic disasters like tsunamis that are also worse.
--> The Arctic may become free of ice.
--> The ozone layer depletion will increase greatly due to a greenhouse gas called chlor-furo-carbon, which primarily emitted by refrigerators, mostly used in china

However, there will be a few positive impacts of climate change:
--> There will be a far longer season for growing crops and agriculture.
--> Energy consumption is expected to decrease slightly due to an overall warmer climate, rendering heating for some countries redundant.
--> Some frozen regions like Canada, might be able to grow crops.

Nevertheless the negative impacts clearly outweigh the seemingly irrelevant positives by a large margin. And in order to stop these implications, action must be taken.
