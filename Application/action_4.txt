What is composting?
Composting is a natural process of rotting or decomposition, of *organic matter*.

It can be executed utilising organic materials like residues form crops, animal waste, food waste, and any organic industrial wastes (mostly from agricultural industry). And it can be used to enhance the compost's application to the soil as a fertiliser.

The mixture or material produced form the completion of composting is called the compost, and can be used as manure for agriculture.

Composting is a great, useful and feasible opportunity to convert kitchen, and industrial organic waste into something that can be used to make soil more fertile, improving soil health, soil biodiversity, which in turn results in better growth of the very crops that we consume, making it a solution that truly benefits us as humans and the environment.

Major types of composting:

Aerobic composting:
-->It is composting In presence of oxygen 
--> A high temperature is required 
--> There is very low nutrient loss, making it more suitable for use in agriculture 
--> Less time required than the other methods
--> Physically demanding work involved 
--> Most pathogens in the compost will get destroyed leading to agriculture suitability 
--> More efficiency than anaerobic Composting 

Anaerobic composting:
--> It is done in the absence of oxygen 
--> Low temperature is required 
--> There is a very high loss in nutrients, making it less suitable for agriculture.
--> More time is required, however, less physical work is involved involved.
--> Most pathogens are not killed resulting in less agriculture suitability.

As can be seen above, there are two main types of composting, and aerobic can be easily carried out by you, by visiting a composting plant, or making sure your waste is correctly handled by your municipality, whereas anaerobic composting is mostly used by large scale industries.
