Here are the two major types of waste:
(if you wish to see the more specific types of waste when it comes to segregation --> please move to the next sub-section)

Organic waste:
58% of all waste generated is readily biodegradable (organic) matter like kitchen waste, garden waste, food waste and paper. Most of the organic waste is put into landfills and incinerators and when they decompose in these environments, methane is released in the absence of air and then carbon dioxide is released (when burned). Both of which are gasses and as mentioned before, they are the direct reason for the increase in temperature due to the greenhouse effect. So better managing this organic waste and finding ways or using ways to recycle them and avoid decomposition would help decrease overall methane emission by at least 1-2%.

Inorganic waste:
Inorganic waste has no direct correlation with climate change, but once we understand the processes behind the production of this waste, a clear correlation will be established. Most of the inorganic waste produced from large Multinational Companies or Industries, who utilise a large number of natural resources in their production processes; the most used being crude oil, metal, timber etc. And as a by-product of the making process, due to the pieces of machinery that are used which are also mostly dependent on crude oil fuels to run, a very large amount of carbon dioxide is produced (Industry accounts for 22% of all greenhouse gas emissions). So, most of the inorganic waste that we have, are all produced in a process with very high carbon dioxide emission and are then disposed of incorrectly into landfills where they take millions of years to decompose and cause chemicals seeping into soil/water contaminating habitats/resources.
 
The best possible way to better the situation is to produce less inorganic waste, but more realistically and thinking from a waste management and not waste reduction perspective, the feasible solution is to segregate the inorganic waste into reusable and recyclable, which prevents more from being produced unnecessarily, thus also decreasing the carbon emissions.
