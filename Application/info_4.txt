We can reduce and prevent the effects of climate change, through:
--> Trees: this has to start by banning any form of deforestation and then planting trees, which will slightly reduce the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere due to their photosynthesis.
--> Alternative energy source: utilising renewable, alternative energy sources like solar energy, nuclear energy, hydro power, natural gas, biofuels (ex: ethanol produced through fermentation of sugar cane), wind energy, geothermal energy or any other energy that does not emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.
--> Correct management of waste: avoiding landfills overall will be the key to minimising emissions form human waste, and then recycling, reusing and refurbishing working products will be the second step in reducing emissions. But the most effective way is to completely cut the input of non-renewable energy sources for the manufacturing sector, and add a refurbishment and recycling sector to all large multi-national companies.
--> Carbon capture: this process involves the removal carbon dioxide from wasteful gasses from power stations or manufacturing outlets, and then storing it inside used up/old oil/gas fields and coal mines, to prevent it from reaching up into the atmosphere.

There have been and will be some implications that were and are inevitable, and in order to cope with them we can only limit their consequences, but not eliminate them, through:
--> Reduced Meat&Diary consumption: we are already aware that cattle and their needs are a very significant contributor to greenhouse gasses, and minimising it can only be done through becoming vegetarians and vegans/
--> Reducing risk of sea level implications: this can be done by using architectural structures like dams to better handle the water flow into endangered (below sea level areas) like in the Netherlands where the Delta works was built in the southwest of the country to prevent floods, and to this day is considered one of the seven wonders of the world.
--> Agriculture: many farmers will have to adapt to the hotter climate where some crops cannot be grown.
