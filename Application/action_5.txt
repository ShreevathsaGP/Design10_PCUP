As can be seen in the diagram above, biogas is produced as a result of anaerobic digestion of animal and or organic waste, this gas is mostly used in the cooking, lighting for agricultural farmers. The gas is produced in large reactors called biogas digesters, and most times does not cost extensive funds and is an environmentally-friendly technology

There are many biogas plants in and around the world, and by responsibly segregating your waste into organic and others, and submitting the waste into municipalities or organisations with Biogas digesters, you can ensure, that all your organic waste is being used for cooking and or lighting energy. And the slurry made for the digester to digest can also be fed to cattle, used as manure, composting, and coating for seeds.
